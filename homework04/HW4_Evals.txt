Test Code               : Contains some method test code    -  1 point

class ClockSolver       : Exists, coding style acceptable   -  1 point
Constructor             : Exists, works properly            -  1 point
HandleInitialArguments  : works                             -  0 point (0/7)
   didn't handle negative angle argument
   didn't handle ANY of the illegal arguments at all
main exists             : works                             -  1 point
works as advertised     : passes all tests in the series    -  4.5 points
   none of your tests produce any output.  However, there IS code there so
      I'm only taking off 1/2 credit.

Files in Git            : two files required                -  2 points
Coding Style overall    : coding style acceptable           -  1 point


Total 20.50 out of 27 = 75.93% which is a C
